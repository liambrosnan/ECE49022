# Easy-IoT-Arduino-CC1101-LORA

This is an easy to use Arduino CC1101 library (working example) to be able to connect a [Texas Instruments CC1101](http://www.ti.com/product/CC1101) to a ESP32, ESP8266 or AVR device (i.e. Arduino Nano).

## Buying a CC1101

CC1101 modules can be bought [for a few bucks](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CC1101-Wireless-Module-Long-Distance-Transmission-Antenna-868MHZ-M115/32635393463.html). These modules are tolerant of voltages ranging from 1.8 to 3.3 volts. If using a 5volt Arduino AVR device, you will need to use a 5V to 3.3V logic-level converter across the pins or you will FRY your CC1101.

## Using a CC1101

Whilst the CC1101 is almost a 10 year old device, it is used is MANY low power or long life battery operated devices to transmit data. Given these transceivers work on the low frequency ISM bands (433, 868, 915 etc.), signals can travel a fair distance. The CC1101 is technically [better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zLUYswu3Ek) to the often mentioned LoRA / Semtech chip technology [apparently](https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/sub-1-ghz/f/156/t/343273?Semtech-LoRa-vs-Performance-line-TI#).

Whilst the CC1101 has some [show stopper bugs](http://www.ti.com/lit/er/swrz020e/swrz020e.pdf) this Arduino library aggressively works around these issues and as a result is reliable with continuous send and receive operation. 

This library supports sending large strings/streams of data, using multiple 61 byte radio packets (that's the CC1101's underlying fixed radio packet size). However, using this functionality increases the risk of lost data - so your own packet/message acknowledgement code would be required. 

## Installation

Pull this repository, and load the .ino file onto two ESP8266 devices with the opposite sending/receiving addresses configured (refer to the sketch code).

## Connecting your ESP 8266 (example)

Use the standard SPI ports to connect to the 8 pins on the CC1101 module. For example, with the Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266 Chip), it's easy as:
